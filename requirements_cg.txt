Tracking orders, parts, and tools required for machine maintenance or repairs.
Employee Management (For Organizations):

Owners and Managers can create and manage employees, assign roles (e.g., Manager, Mechanic, Accountant).

Recommended Improvements to Your Requirements:
Simplify User Roles: Instead of having many sub-roles with slight variations, combine roles where possible. For instance, Admins and Managers can share responsibilities related to organization-level management. Roles like Owner and Manager can be part of the same spectrum with adjustable permissions.

Focus on Key Features First: Start by implementing core features like the machine marketplace, order/rental management, and employee roles. You can add advanced features like analytics and the ticketing system once the core is solid.

Flexible User Roles: Ensure the role system is scalable, where additional permissions can be added later as your project grows. For example, a mechanic could evolve into a more advanced role over time.

Next Steps:
Authentication and Role-based Access Control (RBAC): Start by implementing a robust authentication system that differentiates roles (Super Admin, Admin, Seller, Customer, Employee).

Define Key Data Models:

Machines, Orders, Rentals, Users, Employees, Transactions.
Build the relationships between them (e.g., each Machine has an Owner/Seller, Orders are tied to Machines and Users).
Core Functionalities:

Machine listing, marketplace, order management.
Employee management (adding roles like Owner, Mechanic, Accountant).
Scalability:

Consider designing with scalability in mind (e.g., a ticketing system that grows over time, inventory and financial management that can handle larger datasets).
